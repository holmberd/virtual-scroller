# TODO
- Add support for RTL text direction/scroll.
  - Switch overflow
  - Change threshold calculation?

* If the element's direction is rtl (right-to-left), then scrollLeft is 0 when the scrollbar is
* at its rightmost position (at the start of the scrolled content), and then increasingly
* negative as you scroll towards the end of the content.


- Use clientHeight/-Width or offsetHeight/-Width?
